Notes on compilation:
- Command used: g++ roads.cpp line.cpp point.cpp -o roads.exe -g -Wall -Wextra
COMPILATION ERRORS:
- roads.cpp:23:8: error: ‘sort’ is not a member of ‘std’; did you mean ‘sqrt’?
   23 |   std::sort(roads.begin(),roads.end(), steeper_gradient);
   - This is definitely meant to be std::sort, must include <algorithm>
- point.h:8:7: error: redefinition of ‘class Point’
    8 | class Point {
    - Need header guard

CURRENT WARNINGS:
roads.cpp: In function ‘std::vector<Line>& load(std::ifstream&)’:
roads.cpp:18:10: warning: reference to local variable ‘roads’ returned [-Wreturn-local-addr]
   18 |   return roads;
      |          ^~~~~
roads.cpp:13:21: note: declared here
   13 |   std::vector<Line> roads;
      |                     ^~~~~
- Function is pass-by-reference, do not need to return vector.

roads.cpp: In function ‘void print(const std::vector<Line>&)’:
roads.cpp:32:21: warning: comparison of integer expressions of different signedness: ‘int’ and ‘std::vector<Line>::size_type’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} [-Wsign-compare]
   32 |   for (int i = 0; i < roads.size(); i++) {
      |                   ~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- i is stored as int, roads.size() is a different variable type (long, unsigned int)

roads.cpp:39:10: warning: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true [-Wtype-limits]
   39 |        i >= 0  && gradient(roads[i]) < 10.0;
      |        ~~^~~~
- i is an unsigned int, meaning its impossible for it to be i<0, i >= 0 is redundant

line.cpp: In function ‘double gradient(const Line&)’:
line.cpp:25:14: warning: statement has no effect [-Wunused-value]
   25 |     gradient * -1;
      |     ~~~~~~~~~^~~~
- Value of gradient is not being saved, (should be something like gradient = gradient * -1)

line.cpp: In function ‘bool steeper_gradient(const Line&, const Line&)’:
line.cpp:40:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
   40 | }
      | ^
- Potential for function to not return anything (line1=line2), function is boolean (important fix)

point.cpp: In function ‘double compute_slope(const Point&, const Point&)’:
point.cpp:23:10: warning: unused variable ‘answer’ [-Wunused-variable]
   23 |   double answer = rise / run;
      |          ^~~~~~
- answer is stored as rise / run, yet not used in return statement
