## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

I generally did not have many issues in figuring out the correct recursive processes. 
However, I found the biggest challenge to come with the optimization of my code. Some of the puzzles
I managed to find the result for, but due to the extensive run time, Submitty would not grade
the results.
