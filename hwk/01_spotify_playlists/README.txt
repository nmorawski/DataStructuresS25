## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

I already have a decent background in C++, so I didn't have too many issues. I only had 
some minor issues with taking in strings/text from the input files and correctly cleaning/parsing 
them (had one occurrence of a seg. fault). Also, the song "I" by Kendrick Lamar caused an issue,
becuase at the time, its one-letter long title wasn't picked up with my logic. All in all, the 
development and testing process went great.
