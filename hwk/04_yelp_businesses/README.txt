## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

I did not really run into many issues, only minor problems brought up by my own
improper logic. My biggest issues were solved when I got a better understanding of 
the structure and format of the input data, e.g. the "RestaurantsPriceRange2" very
rarely having a "None" value. Overall, the development and testing process was 
supper smooth.
