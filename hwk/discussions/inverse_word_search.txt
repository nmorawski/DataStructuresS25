In-class discussion (This discussion only focus on the basic logic of the program; optimization is not the scope of this discussion)

Discuss the following questions with students around you.

1. What data structure is good to represent one solution? What data structure is good to represent all solutions?
2. Do we need to initialize the board(s)?
3. What shall we do in the main function?

4. Do we need to track where exactly (in the board) a word is inserted?
5. Do we need to track if one location is occupied or not?
6. Do we need to track if a location is shared by multiple words or not?

7. Is the word search program we have discussed before relevant to this assignment? Can we use some of the logic from that program?
