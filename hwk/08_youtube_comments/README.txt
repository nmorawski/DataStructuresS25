## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

I had next to no issues during the development of my program. The only issues/challenges I
ran into were with memory cleanup/de-allocation, as I would either call too many deletes, or not
enough. I originally structured my delete function as an overcomplicated recursive function, to
which I successfully fixed and shortened.
